          "With the rapid advancement of deep learning technology and generative AI (GenAI) foundational models in recent years, coupled with the establishment of massive image and language databases and the enhancement and widespread availability of GPU computing power, the landscape of image processing, image content generation, and computer vision has significantly changed, leading to a paradigm shift. Many traditional image processing and computer vision methods have lagged behind the current technological progress, making deep generative image models the mainstream technology. This necessitates the introduction of new courses to build a foundational understanding for students' research. This course will be based on the theoretical foundations of statistical learning and will introduce the major deep generative image models developed in recent years. It is divided into three main parts: 1. A brief introduction to basic statistical learning and deep learning techniques, including CNN, RNN, and Transformer. 2. An introduction to the major deep generative image models of recent years, including VAE, GAN, Diffusion Models, and Vision-Language generative models.3. Applications of these deep generative image models in image processing, content generation, and computer vision, including image restoration, deepfake content generation, and image scene understanding.",

As an example, let us imagine that we have the exam scores of all students, and from time to time different student would ask how many other students get a higher score than him/her. In order to speed up the query, one may store the scores in sorted order rather than in a random order. Our focus will be on both the theoretical performance and the practical implementation of the data structures. Pre-requisite: C++ programming",

The first part delves into the critical aspects of software and hardware design in secure system operation, focusing on the architecture and operational methods of secure chips. It emphasizes the role of security functionalities and their importance in safeguarding system integrity. The second part introduces students to fundamental cryptographic algorithms, considerations in algorithm circuit design, and explores malicious attack methods such as side-channel attacks through practical implementations. This section aims to deepen understanding of essential security technologies and design considerations necessary for secure system implementations. The course then extends into the third part, which covers foundational aspects of hardware security in product design. It highlights the significance of hardware trust roots, principles behind physical unclonable functions (PUFs), and essential technologies and applications for design implementation. Throughout the course, real-world examples from market applications and system service scenarios illustrate the operational roles of security features and underscore the critical nature of security countermeasures in modern technology environments.",

While this detailed division of labor enhances the efficiency of electronic product design and manufacturing, it simultaneously raises security threats within the supply chain. This course will elucidate potential security threats hidden within the globalized electronic product supply chain and propose corresponding detection and protection measures. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of common hardware security threats and chip supply chain security protection designs. The course will cover both theory and practice, including the design and automation of highly secure and trustworthy hardware. Through a series of experiments, students will implement common hardware security threats and protection mechanisms, thereby learning to operate relevant computer-aided design tools.",

          "The memory hierarchy plays an increasingly important role in determining the cost, performance, power consumption, and reliability of SoC, mobiles, PCs, and datacenters. Students interested in these industries or research areas may want to have architectural-level knowledge in the memory hierarchy. This course introduces architectural-level techniques of designing, managing, and optimizing a memory hierarchy at all levels, including on-chip caches, main memory, storage caches, and storage. In addition, emerging topics such as active storage and processing in memory will also be introduced.",

Students will also learn to use High-Level Synthesis (HLS) to design and synthesize RTL circuits from SystemC. The HLS-ba<x>sed design can be integrated with a RISC-V virtual platform (riscv-vp) for hardware and software co-design and analysis. Several examples will be used to demonstrate the ESL methodology including image processing, deep-learning neural networks to investigate efficiency of different system architectures.",
